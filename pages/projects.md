Below are some of the free and open source projects I've worked on. All of these
packages are available on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/meoblast001/).

#### KKSystem
###### Since August 2011 - [On GitHub](https://github.com/meoblast001/kksystem)
KKSystem is a web-based flash card system originally developed using Django in
2011. In 2014, the project was translated to Ruby on Rails. The primary
production instance can be found at [kksystem.org](http://kksystem.org).

#### Thugaim
###### Since November 2013 - [On GitHub](https://github.com/meoblast001/thugaim)
Thugaim is a 2D space shooter for Android 2.2+. Originally, the game was
developed for an AI course I took as a student. I decided I like the project and
have continued development on it. Development on this project is ongoing and has
not yet reached a stable release.

#### Hakyll SASS

[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) stylesheets. The package can be found on the
[Hakyll SASS Hackage page](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hakyll-sass).

#### PayPal REST Client for Haskell
###### Since February 2016 - [On GitHub](https://github.com/meoblast001/paypal-rest-client)
This library allows Haskell developers to build applications which connect with
PayPal's REST API. Currently supported features include creating, modifying, and
viewing payments with an existing PayPal account or a credit card. The package
will soon be available on Hackage.
