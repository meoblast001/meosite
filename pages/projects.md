Below are some of the free and open source projects I've worked on.

#### KKSystem
KKSystem is a web-based flash card system originally developed using Django in
2011. In 2014, the project was translated to Ruby on Rails. The primary
production instance can be found at [kksystem.org](http://kksystem.org).

#### Thugaim
Thugaim is a 2D space shooter for Android 2.2+. Originally, the game was
developed for an AI course I took as a student. I decided I like the project and
have continued development on it. Development on this project is ongoing and has
not yet reached a stable release.

#### 3DMeshFileKit
3DMeshFileKit is a Haskell library aiming to provide importers and exporters for
common mesh and scene formats for 3D graphics. This tool is primarily intended
for Haskell 3D games and graphics software. This library is not yet stable but
  will be available on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/) when it is.
