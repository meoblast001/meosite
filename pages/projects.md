Below are some of the free and open source projects I've worked on.

#### KKSystem
KKSystem is a web-based flash card system originally developed using Django in
2011. In 2014, the project was translated to Ruby on Rails. The primary
production instance can be found at [kksystem.org](http://kksystem.org).

#### Thugaim
Thugaim is a 2D space shooter for Android 2.2+. Originally, the game was
developed for an AI course I took as a student. I decided I like the project and
have continued development on it. Development on this project is ongoing and has
not yet reached a stable release.

#### Hakyll SASS
Hakyll SASS is a library for the Haskell static website generator
[Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) used to compile
[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) stylesheets. The package can be found on the
[Hakyll SASS Hackage page](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hakyll-sass)
