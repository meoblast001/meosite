I work professionally in web development and have a hobby interest in game
development. I have experience with C++, C, Python, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby,
C#, and Clojure. I have extensive knowledge with popular web libraries such as
jQuery and Bootstrap. I have limited experience with the OpenGL 3D rendering API
and the Android API.
