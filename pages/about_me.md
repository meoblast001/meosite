title: About Me

I am Braden Walters. Professionally, I am a computer scientist. In addition I
like culture, language, exercise, and long walks on the beach.

#### Software Development

I work professionally in web development and have a hobby interest in game
development, mobile development, web development, and development in general. I
have experience with Haskell, C++, C, Python, Java, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby,
CoffeeScript, C#, and Clojure. I have extensive knowledge with popular web
libraries and frameworks for both front-end and back-end. Examples include Yii,
Ruby on Rails, Django, jQuery, and Bootstrap. I also have limited experience
with the web frameworks Yesod and Snap. Outside of web development, I have
limited, yet applicable, experience with the OpenGL 3D rendering API and the
Android API. Most of my professional work has been in PHP or Ruby, while my
recent hobby work is mostly in Haskell, Java, or Ruby. I have a strong
preference for functional programming and the use of strong type systems or
static analysis to detect defects before run-time and to make analysis and
maintenance of code easier and more accurate.

where I upload all of my free and open source personal projects.

#### Language

I began learning the German language in December 2010 and have continuously
learned the language since. I began learning Swedish in the Autumn of 2011
intermittently.
